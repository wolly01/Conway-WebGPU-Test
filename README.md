# Conway-WebGPU-Test
A small WIP refactor of some old webgpu code running a basic game-of-life

---

At the moment this site just generates a random grid of points and runs game-of-lie at fast as the `requestAnimationFrame` and gpu compute resources allow. after refactoring is fihsined the plan is to add a small form to control things like simulation speed and game-of-life rulesets.
